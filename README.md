# Build Modern Next 14 Server Side App

This repository provides a foundation for building a modern server-side app using Next.js 14 with advanced features such as Server Actions, Infinite Scroll, and Framer Motion Animations.

## Features

1. **Next.js 14:** Take advantage of the latest features and improvements in Next.js to build powerful and efficient server-side applications.
